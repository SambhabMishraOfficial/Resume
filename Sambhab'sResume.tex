        \begin{itemize}
            \item A novel approach to mitigating locust attacks and safeguarding crops involves the application of a ginger and garlic extract mixture, effectively deterring locust infestations by utilizing Allicin from garlic and Diallyl trisulphide from ginger. This concoction acts as an inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, inducing neuroexcitation in locusts and preventing crop damage

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Successfully isolated and characterized the bacteria from the urine sample of the Bladder cancer patients.
            \item The bacteria found in the urine of bladder cancer patient is somehow different from the bacteria found in the urine of a normal human (At genus as well as species level). Analysed using 16s RNA sequencing. Elevation is Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (at phyla level). Fusobacterium nucleatum is abundant in BC patient urine.

}}{}{June 2020 - August 2022}{}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This project was aimed at full characterization of two bacterial pigment i.e. Prodigiosin and Violacein. The pigment prodigiosin was extracted from locally isolated from Serratia marcescens and Violacein was extracted from Chromobacterium violaceum.  Chemical composition characterization using TLC, NMR and GC-MS.The extracted pigment was further checked for different properties including antibacterial, Anticancer, antiparasitic, antifungal, Algicidal, etc.
